# Chrome Based Thesis Translator

This is a small translator developed only for personal use.

However, if you think this software can brighten your life a little bit, feel free to download and use it.

Haven't polished the program due to poor time management, and I've left quite a lot of comments in the program. If my program seems too na√Øve for you, don't mock me please... The program is only developed for personal use.
